📚 Books Recommendation System
A machine learning–based recommendation system that suggests books to users using content-based filtering and Nearest Neighbors on a dataset of 11,000+ records.

🚀 Features
📊 Content-Based Filtering using cosine similarity and nearest neighbor search.

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing for improved recommendation accuracy.

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations to identify rating trends, author popularity, and genre preferences.

🔍 Scalable Model capable of handling large datasets.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Algorithm: Content-Based Filtering, Nearest Neighbors

📂 Dataset
Source: Goodreads Dataset (or whichever dataset you used — replace link if needed)

Records: 11,000+ books with metadata and user ratings

⚙️ How It Works
Data Loading & Cleaning – Remove null values, standardize text, handle duplicates.

Feature Extraction – Use book metadata (title, author, genre, description) to generate vectors.

Similarity Calculation – Apply cosine similarity and nearest neighbors to find similar books.

Recommendation Output – Return top N most similar books for a given input.
